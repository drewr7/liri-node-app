# liri-node-app
- My Liri node application helps users search for songs, concerts and movies. This app utilizes three different APIs to return the user their desired information. 

- The app is setup to take in a request by the user and then return to them the information they requested. The API calls are dependent on the users request. So the user can perform four different request and we will use the api to return them the information.

- To run the app you will open the folder in visual studio code, then you will run "npm install" to install all of the packages. Then open up your command line/terminal. From there you will type in "node liri.js" then one of the following prompts "movie-this", "spotify-this-song", "concert-this", or "do-what-it-says". Once you have typed in one of these prompts you will then need to follow that prompt with the information you are searching for. For example, if you are looking for the song Don't Stop Believin by Journey your command line would look like this "node liri.js spotify-this-song Don't Stop Believin". The command line would look similar for movies and concerts but you would use the different prompts for each. For movies, you would search by movie titile for concerts you search by artist and for songs you search by song name. For some excitement, you can also type "do-what-it-says" to get the random song in the text file.

- Here is the link to the deployed version of my app: https://drewr7.github.io/liri-node-app/

- My Liri application was created using technologies such as node.js to run the app. Javascript as the language supporting the code. NPM(Node Package Manager) to allow me to utilize differnt node packages. Axios to handle http request. FS(File System) to read external text files. As well as, the three different APIs to get information.

- My role in the development of this app was the sole developer of this application.
